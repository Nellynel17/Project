            <strong>
                Fasting juice, </strong> also known as cleansing juice, is a fad diet in which a person consumes only
            fruit
            and vegetable juices
            while avoiding solid foods. It is used for detoxification, alternative medicine treatments, and is often
            part of
            detox
            diets. The diet can typically last two to seven days and include a range of fruits and vegetables and even
            spices not
            found among the juices commonly sold or consumed as part of the average Western diet. Sometimes the diet is
            promoted
            with implausible and unsubstantiated health claims.
        <p>
            <strong>Juices are often consumed for their purported health benefits. </strong> For example, orange juice
            with
            natural or added vitamin
            C, folic acid, and potassium. Juice contains nutrients such as carotenoids, polyphenols, and vitamin C that
            are
            beneficial to health.

            High consumption of fruit juice with added sugar may be associated with weight gain, but not all studies
            have
            shown
            this
            effect. If 100% fruit juice, it may help meet the recommended daily intake of some nutrients.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The juice diet focuses on drinking fruit and vegetable juices throughout the day. </strong> It is
            impossible
            to stay on such a diet for more than five days. It is especially important to go on a juice diet after a
            feast,
            or
            vice versa, before
            going on vacation, when it is important to get a slim figure in a short time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Juice diet has a healing effect. </strong> A rich vitamin complex cleanses the intestines, helps to
            eliminate
            toxins, improves
            metabolism and speeds up metabolism. On such a diet, it is tasty and easy to lose weight.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                The juice diet gives you the opportunity to try different recipes, enjoy bright colors and flavors, and
                show
                your
                imagination. </strong> You are free to choose almost any combination of fruits and vegetables for a
            juice
            detox.
